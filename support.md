# Support

Support is typically available thorugh GitHub Discussions and Issues.

**Found a bug? File an issue.** If you found something that isn't working as expected and you can reproduce it, go to the repo Issues tab and file an issue.

**Want a new feature? Start a discussion.** It's always good to start a discussion (Discussion tab in the project, Ideas category) to explain the problem you're trying to solve before jumping in with the pull request. We may already have a solution in place or have an idea on ways to solve that issue. After the details are nailed down, we will migrate the discussion to a proper Issue (with the `enhancement`) label. At that point, we'd love to see your PRs :).
