# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately by emailing security@devlooped.com. 
You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your 
original message and ping [@devlooped](https://twitter.com/devlooped) on Twitter. 

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
